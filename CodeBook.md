Variables
---

There are, in total, 66 variables in the dataset generated by this script.  Each data point encodes the mean signal recorded by each subject for each activity studied in the variable listed over the entire course of the testing and training period.

- tBodyAcc-XYZ = Time Body Acceleration in X, Y or Z dimension
- tGravityAcc-XYZ = Time Gravity Acceleration in X, Y or Z dimension
- tBodyAccJerk-XYZ = Time Acceleration Jerk Signal in X, Y or Z dimension
- tBodyGyro-XYZ = Time Body Gyroscopic Signal in X, Y or Z dimension
- tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ = Time Body Gyroscopic Jerk Signal in X, Y or Z dimension
- tBodyAccMag = Time Body Acceleration Magnitude
- tGravityAccMag = Time Gravity Acceleration Magnitude
- tBodyAccJerkMag = Time Body Acceleration Jerk Signal Magnitude
- tBodyGyroMag = Time Body Gyroscopic Magnitude
- tBodyGyroJerkMag = Time Body Gyroscopic Jerk Signal Magnitude
- fBodyAcc-XYZ = Fast Fourier Transformed Body Acceleration in X, Y or Z dimension
- fBodyAccJerk-XYZ = Fast Fourier Transformed Body Acceleration Jerk Signal in X, Y or Z dimension
- fBodyGyro-XYZ = Fast Fourier Transformed Body Gyroscopic Signal in X, Y or Z dimension
- fBodyAccMag = Fast Fourier Transformed Body Acceleration Magnitude
- fBodyAccJerkMag = Fast Fourier Transformed Body Acceleration Jerk Signal Magnitude
- fBodyGyroMag = Fast Fourier Transformed Gyroscopic Magnitude
- fBodyGyroJerkMag = Fast Fourier Transformed Gyroscopic Jerk Signal Magnitude

Each variable is followed by:

- mean(): Mean value
- std(): Standard deviation

Transformation
---

- Testing and training datasets have been merged
- All variables not encoding mean or standard deviation have been removed
- Variable names have been assigned as above
- Activity numbers have been replaced with words
- Mean of each variable recorded by each subject doing each activity has been summarised
